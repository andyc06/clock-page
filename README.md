# clock-page
Simple multiple timezone dates & times displayed on a webpage.

I couldn't find a simple/uncluttered digital world clock, so I made one! This uses no external libraries and as such, I'm doing some less-than-ideal string parsing of toLocaleString outputs. There is also some regrettably repetitive code for each of the clock rows. The memory usage seems okay though. :-)
